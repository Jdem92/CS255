Questions answered for Module 8 Journal - 

Q: Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
A: The client DriverPass, wants to provide students with access to online practice exams and on-the-road training to better prepare them for driving tests. The type of system they wanted me to design was a standard web application with a relational database. 


Q: What did you do particularly well?
A: I think I able to hone down on the technical details of the requirements to better understand how the system design would go - that in turn helped me think about future feature releases that DriverPass might want to plan for later down the line. 

Q: If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
A: I think I would want to revise the Gantt chart, and allowing additional time to be alloted for testing on differing platforms to catch any bugs that would otherwise be unknown (or caught in prod from users live testing...). 

Q: How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
A: I just try to hear what the user is telling me and have a conversation about expectations, clear use cases and any anticipated exceptions that we might come across, other than that I try to approach system design in an open-minded way. I think it's important to consider the user's vision when it comes to designing, after all this is being paid for by that user ;) other than that if any base functionality seems out of my grasp I would let that user know, otherwise why not attempt to implement their vision as they see it
